: sign in make files means dependency. And whatever is to the left is the target, so (target	:	dependent);
The Makefiles holds the recipy for creating certain files.

Example:
Out.txt		:		main.exe
	mono main.exe > Out.txt

main.exe	:		main.cs
	mcs main.cs -out:main.exe -target:exe

clean:
	rm --force Out.txt main.exe

> Means redirection, so main.exe is redirectet to Out.txt in the example.
The "clean" command cleans out unnessecary mess created while making of the file.

test-shell:
	echo $$0

When running main we can explicitly tell the target by declaring the target in the Makefile via: make target;
example:
	make Out.txt

You can set default target in Makefile via the keyword default:
example: 
	default: test-shell Out.txt

Be careful when making the Makefile, as the return type of the Main function may break the make of Makefile.
	Therefore make sure that the main function returns 0.
