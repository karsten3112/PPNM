Part A:
Test.txt - contains testing of the plainMC method and a calculation of the integral from the assignment
PlainMC.svg - contains a plot of the estimated error and actual error in a plot to show 1/sqrt(N) scaling

Part B:
QuasiMC.svg - contains a plot of the estimated error to show the scaling of 1/N
Test.txt - contains testing of the quasiMC method in same manner as plainMC
Compare.svg - compares the actual error of both quasiMC and plainMC methods

NOTE: the integral given in the assignment was indeterminate with quasiNewton method
