Part A:
Test.txt contains the solutions for different test-functions also including the extremum of the RosenBrocks function.

Part B:
Aux.svg shows the auxillery function plottet for several different values of the energi.
From this plot were able to give adequate initial conditions for lowest energy.

Conv.svg shows the convergence of the estimated energies with different rmin and rmax values.
