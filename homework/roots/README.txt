Part A:
Test.txt contains the solutions for different test-functions also including the extremum of the RosenBrocks function.

Part B:
Rmax.svg: Shows the calculated energies for several different values of Rmax and fixed Rmin.
Rmin.svg: Shows the calculated energies for several different values of Rmin and fixed Rmax.  

Eps.svg: Shows the calculated energies for several different values of rel. acc. and fixed abs. acc. 
Acc.svg: Shows the calculated energies for several different values of abs. acc. and fixed rel. acc.  

NOTE: The values chosen for eps and acc are chosen relatively large, to shorten runtime

Psi.svg: shows the corresponding reduced wave functions for the found energies using different Rmax's

Par C:
Conv2.svg: shows the calculated energies for different values of Rmax using the better boundary conditions and without.
