calculated values of half-life time T = ln(2)/lambda
without uncertainties on lambda;
T = 4.07981674130838 days
-----------------------------------------------
with uncertainties;
T± = 3.91943384485351 < 4.07981674130838 < 4.25388536526647 days
According to Google the current determined half-life time is T=3.631±0.0002 days
Which does not lie in our interval of uncertainty meaning the fits and data has gotten a lot better since
