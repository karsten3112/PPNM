Part A and B:
Test1.svg: Shows the neuralnetwork trained once to interpolate the given values with Quasinewton min. method and also shows derivative and integral estimate.
Test2.svg: Shows the neuralnetwork trained once to interpolate the given values with Simplex min. method and also shows derivative and integral estimate.
Test3.svg: Shows the neuralnetwork trained once to interpolate the given values with PSO min. method and also shows derivative and integral estimate.


Part C:
Diffeq.svg: Shows the network trained to solve diffeqs. with different min. methods (Quasinewton, simplex and PSO)

NOTE:
The code may take a little time to run since PSO takes a litte time to finish
