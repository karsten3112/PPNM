Part A:
LinPlot.svg - Shows Linear interpolation of points from cos(2x) function and its integral.
				Note: integral should resemble 1/2*sin(2x)

Part B:
Qplot.svg - Shows the quadtratic spline of points from cos(2x) function with derivative and integral.
				Note: integral should resemble 1/2*sin(2x)
				Note: Derivative should resemble -2*sin(2x)
Part C:
Cplot.svg - Shows the cubic spline of points from cos(2x) function with derivative and integral.
				Figure also compares my cubic spline with gnuplots cubic spline - Hard to see since they are on top of eachother
				Note: integral should resemble 1/2*sin(2x)
				Note: Derivative should resemble -2*sin(2x) 

Compare.svg - Shows all splines in 1 plot in comparison
