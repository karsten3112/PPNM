Part A:
Test.txt - contains the results of several tests for the eigenvalue decomposition routine.

Part B:
Rmax.svg - Compares the analytical result of E=-0.5[Hartree] with the found eigenvalue from routine with different values of rmax and dr=0.2
Delr.svg - Compares the analytical result of E=-0.5[Hartree] with the found eigenvalue from routine with different values of dr and rmax=5.0
Psi.svg - shows the reduced wavefunction corresponding to energy: E=-0.5[Hartree] both analytical and calculated

All plots try to show the accuracy of the jacobi-eigenvalue decomposition routine.
