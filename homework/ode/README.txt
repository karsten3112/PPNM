Part A:
HarmOsc.svg - shows the solution produced by the routine of diff. system u''(x) = -u(x)
				Note: implemented RKF45 instead of 12-stepper.

Damped.svg - shows the solution to the damped osc. problem from scipy.


Part B:
Lotka.svg - shows the Lotka-Volterra solution generated by improved driver from scipy.

Part C:
Tbody.gif - Shows a gif of the stable 3-body problem.
