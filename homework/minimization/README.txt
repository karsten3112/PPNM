Part A:
Test.txt: contains some testing of my quasinewton method on RosenBrock- and Himmelblau function.

Part B:
fit.data: contains in the top the determined fitting parameters using the quasinewton method for the Higgs boson.
Higgs.svg: contains a plot of the fitted Breit-Wigner function to the data.

Part C:
Test.txt: contains some testing of my simplex method in same situations as quasinewton method.
fit.data: contains in the top the determined fitting parameters using the simplex method for the Higgs boson.
Higgs.svg: contains a plot of the fitted function with simplex method as well.
